6.8357.235SPEAKER_00 Hello.
7.2558.376SPEAKER_00Hi, how are you?
9.1179.797SPEAKER_00Hello, Merlin.
10.55811.139SPEAKER_00I'm late again.
12.5213.0SPEAKER_03It's all right.
13.3418.064SPEAKER_03I'm usually late to everything, so this is my just desserts.
18.96519.245SPEAKER_03Are you?
19.74621.647SPEAKER_00You don't seem like a late person.
22.40823.269SPEAKER_03It's not that I'm late.
23.44926.771SPEAKER_03It's that, it's that I don't get there on time.
27.15228.493SPEAKER_03Okay.
28.71333.217SPEAKER_03And that's because I don't leave the house with enough time to get where I'm going.
34.56336.404SPEAKER_03 And I don't think that's the same as being late.
36.88447.588SPEAKER_03I think that's I think that is a that is a question that has more to do with like how you perceive space and time.
48.46850.269SPEAKER_03So it's it's more of a science problem.
50.44950.609SPEAKER_00Yes.
51.80756.848SPEAKER_00 Yeah, I mean, the thing I was, in order for you to be late, you would have to have some interest in other people.
57.74958.089SPEAKER_00I think.
59.92960.729SPEAKER_00What would that be like?
60.9561.45SPEAKER_00I don't know.
61.5163.41SPEAKER_00I mean, there's books, probably Wikipedia.
63.4369.112SPEAKER_00But like, if you were late, you would be kind of conscious of the fact that there are other people that had things they needed to do.
69.17270.512SPEAKER_00And I don't think you and I suffer from that.
71.07272.773SPEAKER_00I think it's something that holds a lot of people back.
73.23375.954SPEAKER_00They're constantly thinking like, how will this, how will this affect other people?
76.83477.094SPEAKER_03Right.
77.41478.814SPEAKER_03Who cares is my first thought.
78.85480.155SPEAKER_00I mean, I assume that they think that.
80.19580.655SPEAKER_00I wouldn't know.
81.22381.483SPEAKER_03 Yeah.
82.00482.204SPEAKER_03Right.
83.30584.585SPEAKER_03Well, other people, right?
84.66685.346SPEAKER_03They're the problem.
86.40787.147SPEAKER_00Oh, clearly.
88.28889.209SPEAKER_00Yeah.
89.44994.072SPEAKER_00I mean, you know, this would be a breeze, you know, if it weren't for all the, all those other people.
94.39395.193SPEAKER_03Well, this is the thing.
95.21396.774SPEAKER_03I, I leave the house.
97.555101.378SPEAKER_03If I have somewhere to go, I leave the house in plenty of time to get there.
102.499109.384SPEAKER_03If there weren't other people clogging the roads, necessitating stoplights,
110.805114.608SPEAKER_03 Right, if there were not other people clogging the roads, there would not need to be stoplights.
116.109118.992SPEAKER_00So, I have a... Clogging your roads.
119.252119.732SPEAKER_03My roads.
120.873124.937SPEAKER_03I have a sense of how long it takes for me to get from here, say, to the University of Washington.
126.158128.059SPEAKER_03And that takes nine minutes.
129.941136.086SPEAKER_03But, if there are other people on the roads, which there so often are, then it takes anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes.
138.345139.286SPEAKER_03 which is infuriating.
139.687149.639SPEAKER_03So I usually leave here with nine minutes to spare, sometimes 10 if I feel like I want to take a stroll between my car and the building.
150.981151.862SPEAKER_03It's never enough time.
153.74154.82SPEAKER_00 People-related delays.
154.84156.521SPEAKER_00I struggle with it.
156.881166.544SPEAKER_00I used to be a terminally late person, and I spent many years of my life with a, God bless her, a partner who was terminally late.
166.764172.405SPEAKER_00Like, just crazy, like, you're supposed to be there at dinner for six people, and you arrive as dessert is being served.
172.485173.926SPEAKER_00Like, offensively late.
174.466179.387SPEAKER_00And I became sensitive about it, because I felt badly, and it's nothing against her, but that was her flaw,
183.548186.01SPEAKER_00 It was a flaw that I shared and together it was terrible.
186.11188.191SPEAKER_00That's how a lot of relationships get weird, right?
188.551189.672SPEAKER_00You're both terrible at the same thing.
189.892194.335SPEAKER_00And now I'm really sensitive about it, but I haven't gotten that great at it.
194.555197.236SPEAKER_00I feel like I do what you do, I think.
197.336202.9SPEAKER_00In my head I've got an idea of the greatest conceivable time I have ever made.
203.66204.2SPEAKER_00 to do this thing.
204.22204.861SPEAKER_03Yeah, right.
205.141206.362SPEAKER_00You must do this a lot.
206.402206.943SPEAKER_00Perfect time.
207.103208.143SPEAKER_00Yeah, right.
208.163211.506SPEAKER_00You're in your big blue van, you're driving around, you've got to go from place to place, show to show.
211.886213.147SPEAKER_00You must have some idea in your head.
213.467216.59SPEAKER_00Well, it would never take more than five hours to get to Austin.
217.03220.773SPEAKER_00One time I made it in two hours, so therefore I'll probably be there in about an hour and a half.
221.793240.537SPEAKER_00 You may not do that because you got to do it for your job, but like I feel like I do that all the time I think oh I've got time to get a coffee or I've got time to go stop by the office and do this thing right I have time to sleep for 20 more minutes and take a stroll I'm very curious about something you said a moment ago, which is that?
242.037248.579SPEAKER_03that two people who have the two people With the same they do the same things badly.
248.819250.279SPEAKER_03That's how relationships get weird
252.932254.532SPEAKER_03 That resonated with me.
254.572255.973SPEAKER_00Is that antithetical to your experience?
257.153257.834SPEAKER_03I'm not sure.
257.854267.178SPEAKER_00I think, I mean, I haven't thought about it, but I would guess... Up until just this moment, it's never occurred to me that I did anything bad in any of my relationships.
267.338267.558SPEAKER_03No.
268.058269.879SPEAKER_00Well, I think that's a core competency for you.
269.899270.739SPEAKER_00Yeah, exactly.
270.759277.082SPEAKER_03And now I'm wondering, wow, I always thought it was that she did everything bad.
278.323280.844SPEAKER_03Now I'm starting to consider the possibility that maybe
281.279283.18SPEAKER_00 Yeah, well I mean Coke's not making sailboats, right?
283.4285.281SPEAKER_00They say, look, we were the Coke people, we make the Coke.
285.902287.042SPEAKER_00Let other people make the sailboats.
287.102290.604SPEAKER_00Why would you pick sailboats?
291.105293.186SPEAKER_03I think the cocaine people do make sailboats.
294.186294.787SPEAKER_00Oh, sure.
294.947296.127SPEAKER_00And like prop planes.
296.748300.41SPEAKER_03Yeah, well, or at least they re-engineer sailboats.
300.53303.452SPEAKER_00I should think about this more, but there's probably something to it.
303.712305.213SPEAKER_00I always felt like if you could,
306.952317.501SPEAKER_00 Well, the good thing to say would be terrible at different things is a good idea, but I've always believed that you should both be able to mostly put up with the same stuff.
317.781318.582SPEAKER_00I think that's helpful.
319.302327.73SPEAKER_00But the problem is, for example, if you're both messy, then there's never any countervailing force to make the house stop being messy.
327.83329.211SPEAKER_00It becomes synergistically messy.
329.657336.898SPEAKER_03 Right, but the problem with that is if one person's messy and one person's clean, then you're at war in a different way.
337.219353.422SPEAKER_03I mean, I've felt this about introversion and extroversion because, as I think you and I have talked about this, but I'm a very introverted person despite being an entertainer.
354.782358.003SPEAKER_03And for many years, I thought an entertainer.
358.043359.403SPEAKER_03Did you snicker at entertainer?
360.415363.921SPEAKER_00 I find you extremely entertaining, especially when you're off stage.
363.981365.924SPEAKER_00But no, it's the introvert part.
366.365366.886SPEAKER_03No, no, no.
367.026368.408SPEAKER_03I think I am an introvert.
369.069373.457SPEAKER_03And the definition I use, the description I use of that is that
374.793393.789SPEAKER_03 If you, if you find a room full of people, no matter how much you're enjoying the experience or enjoying their company, if you find a room full of people ultimately draining and you want to and you need to get away and get alone in order to recharge.
394.41394.61SPEAKER_00Okay.
395.09409.794SPEAKER_03 then you're an introvert compared to somebody who finds a room full of people invigorating and they hate to be alone and they want to be in other people's company and they find that they find that's how they charge their batteries.
411.295412.715SPEAKER_03That's my definition of it.
413.276414.296SPEAKER_03It's a little self-serving.
414.536420.818SPEAKER_00No, I mean, I would want to hear a little how you contrast that with a like a psychotic loner.
422.256424.217SPEAKER_00 or sociopathic loner.
424.877427.118SPEAKER_03I'd say that that person was an introvert also.
427.399427.679SPEAKER_03Sure.
428.079443.547SPEAKER_03But in any case, I tried for a long time to only date other introverted people because I was tired, because I didn't like extroverts making demands on my time and space.
444.487451.651SPEAKER_03But I found that when you're in a relationship, even with another introvert, the person who is most introverted
453.083456.546SPEAKER_03 becomes the introvert in the relationship.
456.666464.473SPEAKER_03And even another introvert will exhibit extroverted tendencies in relationship to the other person, right?
465.053468.877SPEAKER_03So this person who would normally be like, oh, leave me alone.
468.937476.383SPEAKER_03I kind of just want to be by myself, is suddenly in the posture of like, why don't you ever want to do anything?
476.423478.425SPEAKER_03Or why don't you ever want to just hang out?
478.485479.806SPEAKER_03And why don't we ever...
481.707496.891SPEAKER_00 It seems like on a molecular level, it seems like there should be some kind of canceling out going on, where if you've got a very messy person who's with a very clean person, I think a molecular scientist would say that therefore you would have an average clean house on the face of it.
496.911499.132SPEAKER_00But I think that in practice that's not the case.
499.272506.714SPEAKER_03Yeah, relationship and human beings consistently fail to be scientific.
508.09511.433SPEAKER_03 You know, like, and that's the problem with psychology.
513.295518.039SPEAKER_03Psychology keeps, for 50 years, has presented itself as a science.
519.18526.186SPEAKER_03And there's really no, there's no demonstrable proof that any of it is working.
527.207531.33SPEAKER_03It's just a lot of, it's just a lot of jabber jaws.
531.35532.872SPEAKER_00Do you think it's a make-believe science?
535.889541.413SPEAKER_03 I don't know if it's a science as much as it is like, so where's the line between a psychologist and a minister?
541.433546.296SPEAKER_00Or you'd have to ask the secretary.
546.856560.586SPEAKER_03Yeah, the psychologist is using the same techniques of talking and listening, but they're undergirding it with some sense that they have a scientific toolbox
561.8568.142SPEAKER_03 They're listening, but they're listening with a scientific toolbox rather than listening with compassion or something.
568.182570.243SPEAKER_00Oh, I see what you mean.
570.263577.606SPEAKER_00You're saying that, but you're talking about like a clinical or like a practicing psychologist as opposed to like a scholarly psychologist.
577.886579.226SPEAKER_00You're saying how's that different from a minister?
579.246586.349SPEAKER_00A minister is somebody who comes in and is a, as a student of the mind and the heart to try and give people comfort.
587.289592.17SPEAKER_00 And so you're talking psychologists more in like in terms of like a therapist, like somebody who would help you feel better.
593.01601.112SPEAKER_03Well, but what is what is what is like an academic psychologist, if not a just someone teaching practical psychologists?
601.373601.793SPEAKER_00I guess.
602.733603.213SPEAKER_00I don't know.
604.713608.274SPEAKER_03It seems it seems to me that that that for for many, many years.
609.835614.796SPEAKER_03The whole premise of the mental health industry was based on a reading of Freud.
617.358629.785SPEAKER_03 people spent decades saying that a lot of the a lot of women's insecurity was based on the fact that they had penis envy and Then one day we decided that that was not true.
629.805630.466SPEAKER_01Mm-hmm.
630.866643.133SPEAKER_03In fact, it was silly But we didn't we didn't throw the Freud out with the bathwater now and Now we think that you know everybody has
644.848656.17SPEAKER_03 You know, that people's insecurity is based on, I don't know, my God, the bookstores are full of, there are shelves of books talking about your insecurity and the root causes of it.
657.11666.612SPEAKER_00What's funny, though, is if you go back, you look at Aristotle or Descartes or a lot of those heavy hitters back in the day, people who laid the groundwork for, obviously, philosophy, but really also for science.
666.652672.273SPEAKER_00I mean, it's not what we would call science today, but back then philosophy was, I think, seen as part of science.
672.333673.493SPEAKER_00It was a way of understanding
674.213679.595SPEAKER_00 you know, how the mind worked, how the universe worked, and it seems like a lot of it was based on these physicalities.
679.615683.057SPEAKER_00Things like, eventually, would come to mean things like humors and stuff like that.
683.077691.481SPEAKER_00But there were all of these, like, Theodoric of York kind of ways to explain based on the physical things, like, why the mental things happen.
691.821701.025SPEAKER_00And then the funny thing with the Freud stuff is it seemed to more and more, yeah, you could say, well, this woman's, the reason this woman is hysterical, from the Greek, is because she has a uterus.
701.205702.386SPEAKER_00So clearly she's crazy.
702.806704.908SPEAKER_03 If I had a uterus, I would be hysterical too.
705.349705.669SPEAKER_00Sure.
705.849707.311SPEAKER_00And she wants a weenus on top of it.
707.351707.932SPEAKER_00That's awkward.
708.492716.121SPEAKER_00You know, but then it's funny because now we're back around to the, to the, uh, to the body stuff where it is, it is very much, it seems to me much more about pipes and wires.
716.441716.601SPEAKER_03Yeah.
716.621719.524SPEAKER_03It's just her black bile is rising up in her.
720.025720.245SPEAKER_00Right.
720.766721.627SPEAKER_00What about pucolic?
722.027725.99SPEAKER_00 Now I get confused, because I think I've read too many reviews of R.E.M.
726.13727.271SPEAKER_00albums, early R.E.M.
727.311727.591SPEAKER_00albums.
727.932731.394SPEAKER_00There's some words where I'm not sure if they mean bodily humors or ways of describing a meadow.
732.035734.377SPEAKER_00So now, quick pop quiz, bucolic.
734.397735.017SPEAKER_00What is bucolic?
735.057736.258SPEAKER_00Is bucolic one of the humors?
736.799739.28SPEAKER_03No, bucolic is like a pastoral setting.
739.341741.142SPEAKER_03Okay, that was my second one.
741.582742.063SPEAKER_03Pastoral.
742.103743.123SPEAKER_00Pastoral is not a humor.
743.624743.824SPEAKER_03No.
744.164745.465SPEAKER_00Okay, what about phlegmatic?
746.006747.147SPEAKER_00Phlegmatic is, yes.
747.687748.668SPEAKER_03That's the phlegm.
748.848749.949SPEAKER_00What about birds-esque?
750.955753.682SPEAKER_03 birds ask now I think that style of the birds.
754.023756.409SPEAKER_03No, I think that's in the same family as bucolic.
756.75758.033SPEAKER_03Okay, it's birds ask.
760.88761.881SPEAKER_00 You know, that's the thing.
761.901766.185SPEAKER_00I understand why everybody wants to explain everything.
766.385771.209SPEAKER_00I think you could argue that you and I would also like to try and explain everything.
771.95773.631SPEAKER_00But you know what it is with the science?
774.172774.952SPEAKER_00It's all the certainty.
775.032776.614SPEAKER_00I'm troubled by the certainty.
776.814780.457SPEAKER_00Like to me, good science should always be going, but you know, I could be wrong.
780.818781.598SPEAKER_03Yeah.
781.638782.599SPEAKER_03See, I'm guilty of that.
782.659787.503SPEAKER_03I'm guilty of using psychology to explain myself and other people
789.896791.718SPEAKER_03 with a fair degree of certainty.
791.798799.644SPEAKER_03And I think I keep in the back of my mind the constant idea that I'm just guessing.
800.504807.61SPEAKER_03But I don't always let the other person know that I think that what I'm saying is just a theory.
808.31811.313SPEAKER_03I say it as though I really believe that it's true.
811.782816.987SPEAKER_00 What's the point that's good writing good writing exactly good good writing is?
817.047818.928SPEAKER_03You know is I inhabit the viewpoint.
819.469820.069SPEAKER_03That's correct.
820.43821.03SPEAKER_00That's correct.
821.35821.47SPEAKER_03Mm-hmm.
822.131830.318SPEAKER_03Yeah But but when I'm sitting across from somebody saying you know what your fucking problem is yes It's a little bit harder for them to see that.
830.358835.723SPEAKER_03I'm just playing a character and in this case It's the character of somebody who knows what their fucking problem is and
836.376839.118SPEAKER_00 That's a good point.
839.298842.24SPEAKER_00It's a good point in the sense of that is a really big problem with you.
844.481846.283SPEAKER_03But I think it's a problem with the world.
846.323849.165SPEAKER_03I mean, like I say, I'm still irritated.
849.205851.146SPEAKER_00That's the second one, just for if you're curious.
851.446852.407SPEAKER_00That's the other problem with you.
856.45859.371SPEAKER_00But then when I say problem, I really mean opportunity stake.
859.412860.712SPEAKER_00Yeah, opportunity stake.
862.534863.614SPEAKER_00I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, John.
863.654865.796SPEAKER_00How is that a problem with the rest of the world?
867.021872.024SPEAKER_03 The problem with the rest of the world is that the rest of the world is not listening carefully to me.
872.044892.355SPEAKER_03No, the problem is that there are a lot of people who put their dumb theories down, advance their dumb theories in their dumb books, but they don't, in order to sell a book, you don't say on the last page, but maybe everything I just wrote is just a dumb theory that I thought up.
893.016895.237SPEAKER_03So think for yourself, love the author.
895.807898.349SPEAKER_00 There's not that much money in saying, but I could be wrong.
898.789899.05SPEAKER_03Right.
899.29906.836SPEAKER_03So, so, so these books go out and, and gullible people read them and they think, Oh, now I know.
908.117909.839SPEAKER_03And they don't know anything.
912.06912.241SPEAKER_03Yeah.
913.021919.587SPEAKER_03Or, you know, or, or, or what it is again, it's a toolbox and, and, and it's only as good as the carpenter.
921.038924.7SPEAKER_03 Your toolbox is only as good as your carpentry.
924.78927.08SPEAKER_00It's the same toolbox that psychologists are listening with.
928.841931.662SPEAKER_00I have a little piece of paper here.
931.682933.043SPEAKER_00I want to make sure I'm keeping all these straight.
934.584936.864SPEAKER_00I think it's problematic.
936.985938.285SPEAKER_00I think all of this is problematic.
938.325942.127SPEAKER_00I think more people should be like John Roderick and just say that a thing is a thing.
942.527944.708SPEAKER_00But on the other hand, I'm also- That's my motto.
944.888945.108SPEAKER_00Yes.
945.508946.048SPEAKER_00Think something.
946.428946.889SPEAKER_00That's right.
946.909947.409SPEAKER_00Service work.
948.55953.716SPEAKER_00 The thing that troubles me, I think, with a lot of this science stuff is, it's not science.
953.896960.244SPEAKER_00I mean, anybody who's out there doing straight science, a lot of them, well, first of all, they're probably working on boner drugs, a lot of them.
960.865961.445SPEAKER_00God bless them.
961.626962.266SPEAKER_00Thank God.
963.411969.895SPEAKER_00 But they, uh, but I mean, if you're doing straight science, you really are doing a kind of, you know, existential improv where you're trying stuff.
969.915970.755SPEAKER_00You're seeing what happens.
970.775971.876SPEAKER_00You're saying, well, here's what we know.
971.956975.658SPEAKER_00And part of being a good scientist, it seems to me is to be able to go, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
975.678978.7SPEAKER_00But here's the thing we said, but here's, it doesn't mean all these other things.
978.76979.141SPEAKER_00There's not.
979.9611000.54SPEAKER_00 this ergo thing that I because I said that then necessarily all these other things are that way that seems feels like good science says a very specific thing based on evidence in context and I feel like that context gets left out you know and this is why so much of the quote-unquote research that you hear on you know in newspapers and NPR is so goofy a lot of the time.
1001.361005.464SPEAKER_00 First of all, it's been strained and drained through all these different sources.
1006.0441012.99SPEAKER_00And a lot of times, I bet the people who conducted the primary research would go, how in the hell did this ever become, like, don't use aluminum pans anymore?
1013.311013.81SPEAKER_00Yeah, right.
1014.3511015.151SPEAKER_00I don't know if that's true.
1015.7721017.893SPEAKER_00But like, I don't know with the psychology stuff, it's hard.
1017.9941022.977SPEAKER_00And it seems like it's almost like, what, like optometrists and dentists and stuff.
1023.0171024.759SPEAKER_00It's like, we're chiropodists.
1026.281031.485SPEAKER_00 The further you are from serious science, the more serious you become, the more you demand.
1031.5251036.569SPEAKER_00Of course, with the height of this being PhDs, demanding that they be called doctor, right?
1036.9891040.092SPEAKER_00God forbid you don't call somebody with a PhD doctor.
1040.2721041.293SPEAKER_03Arrogant bastards.
1041.3531041.573SPEAKER_00Yes.
1042.8231043.644SPEAKER_00 Right on the diploma.
1043.9641062.38SPEAKER_03I feel like real scientists are people who are combining baking powder and vinegar and making volcanoes and as you as you stray from that core science the original science of volcano manufacturing
1063.6241068.189SPEAKER_03 It just gets into fruity pebbles out there in every direction.
1068.2091076.538SPEAKER_03And in all honesty, I think that adulthood is a process of becoming comfortable with ambiguity.
1076.5581080.962SPEAKER_03And I know this about you, that you are comfortable with a certain amount of ambiguity.
1082.5381083.038SPEAKER_03 Yeah, I know.
1083.2781085.74SPEAKER_03I was trying to be nice.
1085.761087.02SPEAKER_03You're drawing that out.
1087.441104.909SPEAKER_03I know you're not comfortable with ambiguity, but I aspire to be comfortable with a certain amount of ambiguity because I know that the life that I perceive is really a television show that I've been living in since I was a little kid.
1106.951109.711SPEAKER_03And so I don't want to get caught masturbating.
1109.7311110.631SPEAKER_00Because you're an introvert.
1114.7491116.271SPEAKER_03 Being an introvert is not easy.
1117.7321118.433SPEAKER_03It's really not.
1119.2141126.261SPEAKER_03And I know a lot of the people listening to this podcast are introverts because that is by definition who listens to podcasts.
1127.3021137.333SPEAKER_03People who like to hear other people's voices only through their car stereo speakers rather than having people sitting in the car with them talking to them.
1137.7591141.321SPEAKER_00 where you come up with this stuff, but it's just a theory.
1141.3411151.887SPEAKER_00I think in some ways, the people who are most loudly saying things, like in our case, we are scientists of a kind, I imagine.
1153.1481153.608SPEAKER_00Scientists.
1153.6481157.971SPEAKER_00Scientists, not in the sense of science, but in the sense of social intercourse.
1161.291162.63SPEAKER_03 Yeah, we're sky intests.
1162.691165.271SPEAKER_00We know we're so That's good.
1165.9911167.511SPEAKER_00That is that is good.
1167.5511172.973SPEAKER_00We're blue blue sky intests We we understand how things should be we understand how people should behave.
1173.0331179.134SPEAKER_00We understand the The Leibniz Ian best of possible worlds that should exist.
1179.4141180.894SPEAKER_00Yeah, we're just here to help.
1181.1141183.935SPEAKER_00We're the pan gloss overs playing glossaries I got nothing
1184.6751194.822SPEAKER_00 uh... the uh... so so the problem is though is that uh... sometimes uh... with people who put things most most strongly but you know what it's part of uh... i think you got your copy this the contrarians creed
1195.8351196.235SPEAKER_02 I wrote it.
1196.5761199.277SPEAKER_00You know, I invented sarcasm.
1199.8971207.582SPEAKER_00If you can find any hole in any of it, it doesn't matter whether you agree with it or not, you've just got to go explore the hole, if you don't mind my saying.
1207.8421220.91SPEAKER_00And I think that's a big part of it, is you or I might say the most ridiculous, bombastic thing in the world just to say that thing, but then you're okay arguing about it and eventually going, hmm, maybe it is this other thing.
1221.491240.057SPEAKER_00 And what bugs me is the personal brand stuff where you're not allowed to, if you're gonna be on brand and you're gonna be that guy who put out that useless book, or you're gonna be this person who's putting out this useless study, you're gonna be harmed if anything about it is shown to be incomplete, inconsistent, or untrue.
1241.3371245.098SPEAKER_00And then your whole world falls apart because, you know what I mean?
1245.3381246.979SPEAKER_00And that's the thing is, now you're dug in.
1247.3991249.48SPEAKER_00Now you're that guy who's gotta defend that until he's dead.
1250.0761263.507SPEAKER_03 I feel like, in a way, that's true of liberalism now, or that's true of the whole liberal half of this country, who are so on brand.
1264.6081269.832SPEAKER_03And over the years, the brand has changed, and every new addition to it
1271.451278.115SPEAKER_03 The liberals feel like they need to embrace it and canonicize it.
1279.0361296.149SPEAKER_03And after a while, the brand is so ungainly, it's so rife with internal contradictions, that liberalism has become meaningless, or if not meaningless, at least it's a multi-headed hydra that can't possibly live, it can't possibly subsist.
1297.271298.911SPEAKER_03And you contrast it against
1300.0031307.916SPEAKER_03 conservatism, which is just as balkanized, but... This isn't just, so I'm clear, this is not going to become about the Tea Party, right?
1308.7571310.16SPEAKER_00Oh, you don't want to talk about the Tea Party?
1310.7211311.923SPEAKER_00Is this a bridge to the Tea Party?
1312.3821313.423SPEAKER_03 No, I wasn't trying to bridge.
1313.5231316.864SPEAKER_03I don't want to interrupt you, but this is, you know, this stuff is on my mind.
1316.9041318.065SPEAKER_03Liberalism is on my mind.
1318.1251319.766SPEAKER_03I don't really give a fuck about the Tea Party.
1319.8861320.086SPEAKER_01Right.
1320.3261326.97SPEAKER_03What I care about is liberalism and how to find some kind of liberalism that's, that's, that's, that's livable.
1327.631338.435SPEAKER_03And I feel like, I feel like the liberals that I know, there are so many things, so many tenants of liberalism that are off the table for talking about anymore because they're part of the brand.
1338.8761339.216SPEAKER_03You can't,
1340.2971341.798SPEAKER_00 It becomes a little bit religious.
1342.3981343.639SPEAKER_00It's absolutely religious.
1343.7391346.702SPEAKER_00All that's holding the family together right now is our belief in the wizard.
1347.2421364.057SPEAKER_00And there's these things that if we start trying to take out all the inessential parts of this or figure out what's debatable about it, what we'll discover is that everything that's left of liberalism today is a reaction to conservatives.
1364.2971371.141SPEAKER_00 There's very little, we're basically, we, whoever considers themselves liberals, I just, I'm so not interested in politics, I can't articulate it.
1371.4811381.507SPEAKER_00And yet, and yet, I think it's very true that basically Muslims are basically like slightly advanced children.
1381.8681392.394SPEAKER_00They're like proto-teenagers in the sense that they know everything they don't like, they don't know that much about what they like, and they know mostly about when they don't want to sit at the lunch table with somebody who doesn't know
1394.0331396.415SPEAKER_00 you know, what the cool liberal thing to do is.
1396.7551398.877SPEAKER_03Yeah, I think that's true of the mass of all people.
1398.9171400.999SPEAKER_00And that's made liberals more conservative than conservatives.
1402.2821413.225SPEAKER_00 That kind of, and you need to look no further than the city that I live in to see how conservative can mean a lot more than your feelings on the gold standard.
1413.6851424.268SPEAKER_00What it can really mean is how didactic or how, what's the word, how canonical, as you like to say, you can become about saying, no, no, no, here's the thing.
1425.4581445.812SPEAKER_00 Reactionary if you like like no this is the this is how we do these things and deferring from that is taking us Off-brand as you would say and it's and it's you know what I mean And it starts really becoming more about like defending your your little house of hay from the the big bad wolf It's less about building the thing you want to make and more about just reacting to what the rest of the world does
1446.5821448.144SPEAKER_03 Yeah.
1448.7251452.71SPEAKER_03I'm now, as I hear you talk, inclined to agree with you that we shouldn't talk about politics.
1452.851453.571SPEAKER_00That's awful.
1454.9731455.553SPEAKER_00It's awful.
1456.1941459.679SPEAKER_00Well, it must be what it's like for you to listen to people talking about anything.
1460.8141464.538SPEAKER_00 It's very hard for me to listen to other people talk about anything.
1465.6191475.267SPEAKER_00Can I just say I'm really glad I don't have to do the books for you on this, but I'm just guessing that many, potentially most people have not consulted you on whether they are even qualified to discuss many issues.
1475.6281475.868SPEAKER_00Yeah.
1476.1281476.589SPEAKER_00Driving.
1476.7691477.65SPEAKER_00I'm going to guess driving.
1478.111478.41SPEAKER_00Yeah.
1478.511480.132SPEAKER_00I know you feel very strongly about driving.
1480.3321480.612SPEAKER_03I do.
1480.6721482.394SPEAKER_03And there are a lot of terrible drivers out there.
1482.8341483.235SPEAKER_03Too many.
1484.0081488.691SPEAKER_00 Can I, I was going to try and get back to the relationship thing, but that's too late now.
1488.8911492.013SPEAKER_00Now the driving thing, you seem to feel very strongly about driving.
1492.0731498.258SPEAKER_00I know several friends that, and I've gotten the feeling from you that it has to do with your Alaskan background.
1498.3181502.861SPEAKER_00I think at one time you said you offered to, I think, put a broomstick up my ass because I wanted to drive.
1503.1811504.622SPEAKER_00I don't remember the exact context.
1504.7021507.584SPEAKER_00It's probably a phrase you, is in parlance with your types.
1508.0441518.226SPEAKER_03 Yeah, well you grew up in Florida where I mean the highest elevation in Florida is like three phone books stacked on top of one another Yeah, so how would we don't even have rulers?
1518.3061521.827SPEAKER_00So we don't even know how what that is in inches or whatever you would you know how to drive?
1522.3071530.229SPEAKER_03You just you point the car and then and then start I don't know giving yourself a manicure and then you're at the you're at you've arrived Yeah, let's eat oranges.
1530.2491532.61SPEAKER_00I'm in Florida Look at me
1534.0451535.266SPEAKER_00 Wow, I'm in Florida.
1535.4661536.648SPEAKER_00Is that baked into the culture there?
1536.6681538.67SPEAKER_00You got the gas, you got the gas, you know, not the gas.
1539.231543.875SPEAKER_03No, it's I mean, Alaska is a part of it, but there are some terrible drivers in Alaska, too.
1543.9551547.799SPEAKER_03No, I feel like it's driving is driving is much more.
1548.4191551.642SPEAKER_03It's it's very easy to be a driver.
1551.7831553.544SPEAKER_03It's very hard to be a good driver.
1554.1251555.106SPEAKER_03You have to understand.
1556.3071581.996SPEAKER_03 You have to understand a lot of things you have to you have to be able to bring a lot of things to bear and you have to have peripheral vision and you have to be looking 20 seconds ahead and all these all these things that get in the way of people You know jamming out to banana Rama or whatever it is that people do in their cars The implication that Almost nobody, but you is able to do well is that that?
1582.4121583.992SPEAKER_03 No, I see good drivers sometimes.
1584.0521587.153SPEAKER_03I'll be driving along and a guy will drive by or sometimes a gal.
1587.2931589.414SPEAKER_00Do you guys have a wave or a handshake or something?
1589.4541590.214SPEAKER_00You got a horn honk?
1590.2741591.674SPEAKER_03No, it's much more of a like, hmm.
1592.1341593.635SPEAKER_03And then he looks over and goes, hmm.
1594.0951597.616SPEAKER_00It's like being a tough guy where you could just look at somebody and go, that guy's wiry.
1597.6761598.736SPEAKER_00He could be an ultimate fighter.
1598.9361603.537SPEAKER_00Like you see somebody driving, you might see a lady in the store and just go, I can just tell she's a good driver.
1604.111609.632SPEAKER_03 Yeah, you just, you watch a person navigate through their environment.
1609.6721619.456SPEAKER_00Grocery store, you could probably tell, or at least I can just say, and I don't want to, I don't want to go into the things we go into sometimes, but in my neighborhood, it's very clear who's not a good driver.
1620.1561621.256SPEAKER_00Just go to the grocery store.
1621.6171621.837SPEAKER_03Right.
1622.2971622.437SPEAKER_00Right.
1622.8171624.718SPEAKER_03 Well, it's very clear who's not a good person.
1624.8181634.38SPEAKER_03Well, if you can't navigate your way through a grocery store without inconveniencing other people, no, without without making yourself an obstacle, there should be a tribunal.
1634.7411635.741SPEAKER_00Then you're a bad person.
1635.8011638.502SPEAKER_00There should just be there should be people that are just taking you out of there.
1638.5221638.542SPEAKER_00I.
1640.7521642.172SPEAKER_03 The Soylent Green people, right?
1642.4321643.793SPEAKER_00I taught my daughter this.
1643.9331644.293SPEAKER_00That's right.
1644.4131645.733SPEAKER_00Well, I don't even know if I want to eat that.
1645.9131651.954SPEAKER_00But the thing I said to my daughter, I've taught her this is the most important thing we must teach our children, is the two rules of the grocery store.
1652.2941653.854SPEAKER_00You keep moving and you get out of the way.
1654.7351657.715SPEAKER_00If you're not going to keep moving, get out of the way.
1657.7351660.236SPEAKER_03If you can't get out of the way, keep moving.
1660.2961661.536SPEAKER_00Keep moving and get out of the way.
1661.8361662.676SPEAKER_00This is ape law.
1663.1961665.877SPEAKER_00Everything you must know about the grocery store, keep moving and get out of the way.
1666.0771667.157SPEAKER_00If you can't do one, do the other.
1667.5771667.837SPEAKER_00Always.
1668.0571668.317SPEAKER_00Always.
1668.6971684.752SPEAKER_03 That should be that should be a t-shirt and and get out of the way should be I think what most people think of all the time and and even though I present as a fairly like as a fairly Alpha personality, let's say
1685.9851689.888SPEAKER_03 I am always thinking to myself, do I need to get out of somebody's way?
1690.9491692.531SPEAKER_03You know, I'm always looking in the rearview mirror.
1692.6711694.092SPEAKER_03I'm always walking around the grocery store.
1694.2921698.796SPEAKER_00The answer is not always yes on a variety of levels, but the question is always there.
1699.0761703.48SPEAKER_03Some people I don't get out of their way because they need to feel me in their way.
1704.6011704.801SPEAKER_03 Right.
1705.2411706.902SPEAKER_00In ways they don't realize.
1706.9221707.242SPEAKER_03That's right.
1707.2621710.364SPEAKER_03They don't understand it, but it's good for them ultimately that I'm in their way.
1710.9641715.446SPEAKER_03But for instance, I went to a movie at an art house theater the other night.
1716.6271718.488SPEAKER_03And, you know, it's an art house.
1719.3481721.269SPEAKER_03It's a place called the Seven Gables in Seattle.
1722.3291726.67SPEAKER_03 average age of the people in this movie theater is 55 years old.
1727.6111735.933SPEAKER_03Everyone is wearing some kind of Patagonia garment or some kind of thing from REI.
1736.4731740.715SPEAKER_03You know, it's a very university audience of people.
1740.7951741.835SPEAKER_00A lot of carabiners.
1742.8551745.076SPEAKER_03Some carabiners on people's keychains.
1745.8961751.158SPEAKER_03And they're there to watch, you know, a small, a smaller film, not a widely released film.
1752.6271765.774SPEAKER_03 And I swear to you, there was more audience noise during this film, which was a film about the Holocaust, right?
1765.8141767.695SPEAKER_03I mean, it's not a film that, it's not like,
1773.6491797.98SPEAKER_03 You know and I'm thinking to myself this is this audience is louder than the audience at a Queen Latifah film and it's because Every person in the audience feels like they need to make some kind of some kind of audible response to every plot twist to every To every you know shocking moment everybody in the place has to go oh mmm
1802.8251826.325SPEAKER_03 You know and I felt like standing up in front of the screen and saying you people shut the fuck up like You are this is not an audience participation film and you're you know the fact that you are grokking the the plot twist Doesn't need to be punctuated with a little like a like a groan from you Like your grandparents yelling the answer on Wheel of Fortune
1830.5331832.234SPEAKER_03 Well, that's in the privacy of their own home.
1832.4941833.074SPEAKER_00But that's right.
1833.1741833.855SPEAKER_00I mean, that's the thing.
1833.8951845.0SPEAKER_00I mean, you take a combination of the kind of like everybody gets to comment on everything aspects of the Internet combined with the NPRness of owning a lot of things from REI and being used to be able to write letters to The New York Times.
1845.2811846.261SPEAKER_00You go into a theater with that.
1846.2811847.622SPEAKER_00That's a deadly cocktail, my friend.
1847.9821848.222SPEAKER_00Yeah.
1848.3421850.323SPEAKER_00And the Holocaust, was it the X-Men movie?
1850.3631850.823SPEAKER_00What was it?
1850.9841851.744SPEAKER_00Was it a Holocaust movie?
1852.1531854.595SPEAKER_03 Wait a minute, is there, does the X-Men movie have the Holocaust in it?
1854.6751855.356SPEAKER_00Oh, you betcha.
1855.6961858.138SPEAKER_03Oh, see, anything that has the Holocaust, I'll go see.
1858.2381858.618SPEAKER_03Is that right?
1859.0781874.931SPEAKER_03No, it was that one about the Israeli, it's kind of like Munich except not as good, about the Mossad agents who kill the, or who go to kidnap the Mengele-type doctor and they
1875.9331876.634SPEAKER_03 I won't give the ending.
1876.6541878.135SPEAKER_00Yeah, no spoilers, no spoilers.
1878.5351885.982SPEAKER_00But see, this gets us to a deeper problem, John, and it's a much broader problem, and it's ultimately why I fear a true depression, which is that nobody knows how to stand in line.
1886.1821891.027SPEAKER_00If you had to bring it down to one thing, well, the one thing is we don't really know how to act around people anymore.
1891.4071893.549SPEAKER_00 But the theater, it all comes together in the theater.
1893.6691897.812SPEAKER_00The theater is the worst of humanity jammed into a room with sticky floors.
1898.2531901.255SPEAKER_00And it's everything, oh, I don't know, the grocery store might be worst.
1901.3751906.68SPEAKER_00If there was a grocery store that had a movie theater, that would be the absolute worst of humanity.
1906.71909.322SPEAKER_00You wouldn't be able to get to your seat and people would be yelling.
1909.6021914.244SPEAKER_03 This is a hell of a business model, I think, this grocery store movie theater thing.
1914.3041915.085SPEAKER_00As a punitive thing?
1915.4451920.307SPEAKER_03It's like a beer pub pizza parlor movie theater, except you're actually getting shopping done too.
1920.4071922.068SPEAKER_00Oh, so you could have like artisanal beers.
1922.1081925.81SPEAKER_00You come in, you get, if you can find your table, first of all, you're going to have to find your table.
1925.991929.792SPEAKER_00You're going to get past this lady here who's really diligent about getting her free sample.
1930.2521931.674SPEAKER_00 Madam, can I just explain something to you?
1931.7141932.595SPEAKER_00Hi, this is my daughter.
1933.0561934.658SPEAKER_00I hope she sees the age of four.
1934.9981945.652SPEAKER_00My concern is that if you and the rest of the sand people do not move away from the tiny bits of sausage on toothpicks, I will literally die in a dirty, safe way, standing behind somebody cheap.
1946.4331947.855SPEAKER_00And that's just not how I see this ending.
1948.351952.511SPEAKER_03 while Ghostbusters 3 is playing on the wall.
1953.0711953.731SPEAKER_00That would be good.
1953.9511957.092SPEAKER_00I took my daughter to one movie and it was excruciating.
1957.3321958.692SPEAKER_00I can't believe what has happened.
1958.7921963.353SPEAKER_00This is a dumb, like, cliche, but it's unbearable to go to the movies.
1963.4531968.194SPEAKER_00Setting aside the $80 that it cost the two of us to see Winnie the Pooh, it was awful.
1968.2741969.254SPEAKER_00Everything about it was awful.
1969.9341974.815SPEAKER_00The commercials before the trailers were awful, the trailers were awful, the movie, it was all awful.
1974.8351975.335SPEAKER_00Yeah.
1976.3951997.547SPEAKER_03 Like you say it's like a Queen Latifah thing like everybody's just yelling yelling and yelling stuff and talking and playing with their phones Yeah, well, you know I think what it is is that sometime When we were kids the the school curriculum was still based on the premise that we were trying to beat the Russians to the moon Even though we we'd already beat the Russians to the moon.
1997.7872000.208SPEAKER_03We were still reading those same math books and
2001.3652003.948SPEAKER_00 We wanted to get to the moon, and we wanted them not to get to them.
2004.0282004.468SPEAKER_00Yeah, right.
2004.5082022.603SPEAKER_03We wanted a lot of work your face But then somewhere there in the in the 70s the Alan Alda vacation of America Happened and suddenly everybody was an artist nobody was a nobody had a slide rule anymore.
2022.6632026.486SPEAKER_03Nobody was trying to get us to the moon now everybody
2027.9572041.032SPEAKER_03 Now everybody was free to be and we were all, our little hearts needed to be set free and we needed to talk about our feelings and everybody needed to share.
2042.0292049.792SPEAKER_03 And now we live in a nation of 350 million of the most important people who have ever lived.
2049.9922070.999SPEAKER_03Nobody can wait in line, nobody can admit for a second that maybe in the grand scheme of things, they are a peon and they need to shut the fuck up and get in line and do their jobs and get out of the way of better drivers who are on their way to some place and only have nine minutes to get there.
2071.432072.93SPEAKER_00 I think that I finally understand it.
2073.052076.311SPEAKER_00Okay, it's a problem with at least two levels.
2077.0712081.892SPEAKER_00The second level is that the people are in your way.
2082.1922084.773SPEAKER_00They're making it take way more than nine minutes.
2084.8132086.973SPEAKER_00You're not gonna get the chance to have a walk or a nap.
2087.3542088.234SPEAKER_00They're in John's way.
2088.7942097.756SPEAKER_00If I understand correctly, the first much more broad problem, we're never gonna get to problem two until we get through problem one, is that people are literally not being forced to literally listen to you.
2099.3072104.351SPEAKER_00 Because you could, that's part of the problem is people are getting, can I say, John, I think people are getting a mixed message.
2104.7912114.778SPEAKER_00And the mixed message is there are people besides John that are giving them advice, if any advice, and that you're, what you have to share with them is getting lost and missed all the voices and talking about feelings.
2115.2592115.899SPEAKER_00Is that fair to say?
2116.542121.303SPEAKER_03That is fair to say, except that with the caveat that I don't really care if they're listening.
2121.6232123.685SPEAKER_03I just want them to be quiet while I'm talking.
2124.7482131.331SPEAKER_03 You know if they are just sitting there just just dumbly Watching so it's not really about the movie.
2131.4912144.036SPEAKER_03It's the movie is a really the movie is you the problem is they're talking during you They're talking during me or they're fidgeting even during me They should just be content if they if they can't understand what I'm saying.
2144.0562144.877SPEAKER_03They should just watch
2145.7172150.099SPEAKER_03 Dust might flood floating through the air or something, but they need that.
2150.1592170.687SPEAKER_00I think we need to return to us Don't know what it is 1915 model of like rulers on the knuckles We got a whole room full of kids that need a lot of learning Please don't distract from that If you can't if you cannot sit in your seat and listen to what John has to share with you then maybe maybe me know what we will move you down to the the room with the helmet kids because this is for people who are serious about life and
2170.8272175.81SPEAKER_03 There's a phrase for this, and I think, and it isn't just, it's not John-centric.
2176.272177.791SPEAKER_03The phrase is good citizenship.
2178.0912178.311SPEAKER_00Sure.
2178.9312183.674SPEAKER_03Good citizenship is listening to John.
2184.0142184.214SPEAKER_00Yes.
2186.7122194.097SPEAKER_00 I said this to lots of people when they annoy me, but I think there's a misconception also about the idea of etiquette or good manners.
2194.8382198.7SPEAKER_00And you go pick up any good book on etiquette or good manners, and it will tell you this.
2199.0612201.842SPEAKER_00It is not about yelling at people about where the fork is.
2202.2432205.245SPEAKER_00Good manners and etiquette are about making other people feel at ease.
2206.1652213.088SPEAKER_00 The whole reason that we have manners and we have etiquette is so that you don't have to feel uncomfortable about knowing which fork is for the shrimp.
2213.5892219.451SPEAKER_00It's not about browbeating people about which fork they used incorrectly and I think that's a big part of the problem.
2219.6912225.214SPEAKER_00I think we get hung up on all of the what the rules part are without understanding why the rule existed.
2225.7942233.398SPEAKER_03And what's nice about rules is everybody agrees on what they are and then you get on with life and unfortunately now
2235.3632241.887SPEAKER_03 We got so fixated on the fact that the rules were based on a bad system.
2241.9672250.492SPEAKER_03The rules were imposed by European colonialists or imposed by rich people.
2250.6522253.053SPEAKER_03And that, in principle, was bad.
2253.5932256.135SPEAKER_03The rules favored the colonialists.
2256.1952257.295SPEAKER_03They favored the rich people.
2257.8162262.438SPEAKER_03But more importantly, just the fact, even the rules that were good, that were neutral,
2264.2192275.965SPEAKER_03 The fact that they had come from these bad people, these oppressive people, was enough to not only question the rule, but to assume that the rule was bad.
2276.0452282.589SPEAKER_00And to assume that perhaps rules altogether are a bad idea because that's a phallocentric conceit of the colonialist government.
2282.9552285.716SPEAKER_03 Well, except that everybody's got rules.
2286.9762295.797SPEAKER_03So it's not that rules are, I don't think anybody assumed, except for anarchists and people on 4chan, I don't think anybody thinks that rules are bad.
2296.1772298.958SPEAKER_03It's just that they wanna make their own set of rules.
2299.5782310.16SPEAKER_03They wanna make the rules, they wanna cobble together some rules from the things that their parents told them that they didn't resent, some of the crackpot ideas that they read in some magazines,
2311.02318.158SPEAKER_03 some things that came to them in a dream and one or two arbitrary things just to make other people
2319.0672321.528SPEAKER_03 You know, just to keep people jumping.
2322.1292327.591SPEAKER_03And then people walk out of the door and they're like, these are my rules, and everybody get out of the way.
2327.6112334.135SPEAKER_03And it may sound like that's what I'm doing, but that's not what I'm doing at all.
2334.3552336.456SPEAKER_00If you're doing that, you're doing it at a much deeper level.
2336.6562339.317SPEAKER_03My rules are ancient.
2339.9782341.298SPEAKER_03I'm using ancient rules.
2343.2352343.435SPEAKER_00 Yes.
2343.7762351.183SPEAKER_03But my rules can't compete with somebody who read The Secret because Oprah told them to, and now they've got a bunch of rules based on The Secret.
2351.4632354.746SPEAKER_00That starts to really degrade the whole idea of what a rule is, you know?
2355.1872357.93SPEAKER_00At the point when you introduce that much magical thinking.
2358.752361.711SPEAKER_00 I gotta tell you, buddy, I think keep moving and get out of the way.
2361.9112363.131SPEAKER_00I mean, that's not too far off.
2363.1712364.032SPEAKER_00Those are basic rules.
2364.2722365.972SPEAKER_00That is, you know, it really is.
2366.1722368.193SPEAKER_00It's sort of one of those rules like flush.
2368.5932368.953SPEAKER_00You know what?
2369.0132369.293SPEAKER_00Flush.
2369.9532370.393SPEAKER_00It's okay.
2370.4942370.854SPEAKER_00Flush.
2371.1942371.814unknownYeah, right.
2372.0142372.714SPEAKER_00That's a good rule.
2373.0542374.815SPEAKER_00If it's yellow, don't let it mellow.
2375.0752375.975SPEAKER_00No, no, seriously.
2375.9952376.675SPEAKER_00That's dumb.
2376.8552377.796SPEAKER_00If it's yellow, flush.
2377.8362378.436SPEAKER_00That's just mnemonic.
2378.4562379.336SPEAKER_00Send it away.
2379.4762380.697SPEAKER_00Here's your mnemonic, flush.
2381.0572381.437SPEAKER_00Yeah.
2381.6372382.017SPEAKER_00That's it.
2382.0972383.858SPEAKER_00Hey, do you live in a tree house?
2383.8782384.558SPEAKER_00No, you don't.
2384.5782384.778SPEAKER_00Exactly.
2386.8972390.941SPEAKER_00 These are these are things that we're passing on to our children You know if you make a mess clean it up.
2391.5012412.758SPEAKER_03You know if you read Mike if you if you read Mark Twain All this is in there if you read if you read Hemingway, it's all there yeah flush right I mean if Hemingway doesn't have a short story titled flush well he doesn't but he should have and I think I think that message is it's threaded through a
2413.9722415.993SPEAKER_03 It's through all cultures.
2416.2332416.453SPEAKER_00Right.
2416.8732417.113SPEAKER_00Right.
2417.1932421.795SPEAKER_00That it's difficult to not be able to get erections and you should flush.
2422.2552422.715SPEAKER_00I think it's there.
2422.7352423.776SPEAKER_00That's the old man in the sea.
2424.5162424.736SPEAKER_00Right.
2424.7562425.496SPEAKER_00It's you know.
2425.5162431.258SPEAKER_03Have sympathy for men because it's sometimes hard to get an erection.
2431.4982431.899SPEAKER_00That's right.
2432.4392434.76SPEAKER_03That's that's one of the top 10 rules.
2434.842435.86SPEAKER_00And then be taciturn.
2437.12440.562SPEAKER_03I mean why do you think I mean men get a bad rap.
2442.2852443.485SPEAKER_03 But it's hard to be a man.
2443.9652444.646SPEAKER_00From women you mean?
2445.8462447.086SPEAKER_03Well, no, from men too.
2447.1462454.328SPEAKER_00From, you know, these men that... You think that's an Alan Alda thing or a Fleece thing?
2454.6682456.308SPEAKER_03I think it's an Alan Alda thing.
2456.4682456.808SPEAKER_00Could be.
2456.8682461.709SPEAKER_03I mean, Fleece came directly from Alan Alda.
2462.372464.09SPEAKER_03There was no Fleece before Alan Alda.
2465.132470.832SPEAKER_00 You know, I would have to, I would have to Google, no, please don't use that word fallacy.
2471.7122473.673SPEAKER_00It's, uh, it's got a dick right in the middle of it.
2473.9732476.934SPEAKER_03Is that, is that one of John Worcester's word hates?
2477.0342478.095SPEAKER_00You got to introduce me to that guy.
2478.1152478.715SPEAKER_00I mean, I've met him.
2478.7552481.416SPEAKER_00He won't remember meeting me, but you gotta, it sounds like you guys are pals from the Twitter.
2481.4362483.317SPEAKER_00You gotta, I need drum loops from that guy.
2483.6772484.877SPEAKER_00I desperately need drum loops.
2485.2172488.859SPEAKER_03Being pals with John Worcester is, it's more difficult than it looks.
2489.1192489.359SPEAKER_00Really?
2489.9192512.49SPEAKER_03 Well John Worcester is a very kind of little monkey He's an extremely funny and extremely intelligent person who has carved out a life for himself in rock and roll which is a world of morons and So John Worcester has done with what a lot of smart people in rock and roll has done which is he's he's very careful not to He doesn't like
2514.0752520.84SPEAKER_03 Put streamers up and balloons up just because you say something funny to him a couple of times You know he's not like oh my god.
2520.922522.021SPEAKER_03Hi be my friend.
2522.0412524.463SPEAKER_00You know he's What did you do?
2524.5432526.304SPEAKER_00How'd you get in there who me?
2526.3442526.504SPEAKER_03Yeah?
2526.7242526.864SPEAKER_00Well?
2526.9852533.729SPEAKER_03I wouldn't even I wouldn't even say I was in there hmm I mean we we did a tour together and when and we like each other, but it's there's still
2535.1782545.585SPEAKER_03 No, he was playing drums in the Jay Farrar, Ben Gibbard, Jack Kerouac based side project band.
2546.6262548.587SPEAKER_03And I did a tour with them.
2548.7282549.148SPEAKER_00That's right.
2549.8332565.678SPEAKER_03 But I think John Worcester and I, even though now we've known each other for a couple of years, we're still in the friendly circling stage where we say, oh, hello, you, yes, well, there you are.
2565.8582567.919SPEAKER_00Arched eyebrow and you sniff his chair.
2568.2792578.302SPEAKER_03Yeah, yeah, there's a little bit of chair sniffing and it's not, I don't, I never, I do not approach someone like John Worcester with the expectation that he is gonna appreciate
2580.3122582.534SPEAKER_03 that I am one of the greatest living men.
2583.9752586.497SPEAKER_00See, this is another one of the, that's the problem again.
2587.6382593.543SPEAKER_03But in the case of somebody like John Worcester, I don't consider it a problem because John Worcester
2594.2772600.078SPEAKER_03 probably when he's lying in bed at night, also suspects that he may be one of the greatest living men.
2600.0982606.019SPEAKER_03And there's not a lot of room in town for too many greatest living men.
2606.0792611.461SPEAKER_03You can't have that many of them in the same small Western town or there's going to be a gunfight.
2612.0812612.481SPEAKER_00Absolutely.
2612.5012618.222SPEAKER_00And the pity of it is that because of the nature of this challenge is you will never be able to have a benefit
2619.3422619.962SPEAKER_00 to help these men.
2619.9822622.423SPEAKER_00Because first of all, all of you guys hate playing benefits.
2622.8032627.285SPEAKER_00But second of all, the people who need it the most, the men who are asking themselves these questions.
2628.0652633.607SPEAKER_00The men who are asking, am I of a caliber of somebody who would want to hang out with me?
2634.4472637.151SPEAKER_00 I think you're not always getting the help you need, let alone the audience.
2637.9112639.033SPEAKER_00I don't know how you do that.
2639.4932640.394SPEAKER_00You hate playing benefits.
2640.4142641.796SPEAKER_00You don't hate playing benefits.
2642.0162643.478SPEAKER_00I think you've been very clear about it.
2643.6782646.902SPEAKER_00You hate the hypocrisy of not paying the band for benefits.
2647.8232650.045SPEAKER_00And I have to imagine that John Worcester doesn't like people either.
2650.7422651.002SPEAKER_03 Yeah.
2651.2822653.564SPEAKER_03I mean, I don't hate not paying the band for benefits.
2653.6842657.907SPEAKER_03I just hate paying everybody but the band for benefits.
2658.1872658.387SPEAKER_03Right.
2658.4272664.652SPEAKER_03I mean, I wrote that article for The Weekly just saying, hey, if you're if it's a benefit, then everybody should work for free.
2665.5742670.457SPEAKER_03 if it's a benefit and all the production people and the promoters are getting paid.
2670.7172671.097SPEAKER_00Yeah.
2671.1772672.958SPEAKER_00No, let me just be clear.
2672.9782674.038SPEAKER_00Giving their money away?
2674.1182682.162SPEAKER_00This may be the third or fourth time our audience has heard it, but I would say you republished it in the weekly after having run it several times in my kitchen.
2684.0232689.826SPEAKER_00I've read this particular article on numerous occasions before it was ever in whatever print is nowadays.
2689.8662695.049SPEAKER_03I think the version that I wrote in your kitchen was the best version.
2695.4092696.629SPEAKER_00 It had a lot more F words in it.
2696.6692697.87SPEAKER_03I had to water it down.
2698.052698.97SPEAKER_00A lot of water.
2699.052700.571SPEAKER_00There's a movie called Rules of the Game.
2700.5912703.111SPEAKER_00It's about sports?
2703.5722704.052SPEAKER_00I hope not.
2704.5922708.113SPEAKER_00It's a very old, I want to say Renoir, but I always get the name wrong.
2708.1532709.473SPEAKER_00But there's a great quote from that movie.
2710.7942714.455SPEAKER_00The awful thing about life is this, everyone has his reasons.
2716.012718.772SPEAKER_00 And for some reason, I find that quote kind of indelible.
2718.7922720.313SPEAKER_00I had to Google it to get the exact wording right.
2720.3532721.694SPEAKER_00But the awful thing about life is this.
2721.8142722.735SPEAKER_00Everyone has his reasons.
2723.0552724.356SPEAKER_00And I think that's a lot of what you're saying.
2724.7162725.997SPEAKER_00I think everybody has their reasons.
2726.2772734.503SPEAKER_00This is not a value judgment, but I think the person who's standing in the middle of the fucking aisle while I just want to get some fucking pasta, I can see it.
2734.8432735.424SPEAKER_00 It's right there.
2735.6442736.205SPEAKER_00I could see it.
2736.2852737.187SPEAKER_00I could see the brand.
2737.5272738.368SPEAKER_00I got the kind I want.
2738.3882738.969SPEAKER_00I want the thin.
2739.0092739.971SPEAKER_00I don't want the vermicelli.
2740.0112740.612SPEAKER_00I don't want the fat.
2740.6322741.293SPEAKER_00I want the in-between.
2741.3132741.653SPEAKER_00I could see it.
2741.6732742.014SPEAKER_00It's right there.
2742.1742742.615SPEAKER_00But you know what?
2742.8552743.456SPEAKER_00You're standing there.
2743.4762745.94SPEAKER_00You're standing there because you're having some kind of little moment.
2746.02748.263SPEAKER_00Now, I've got my reasons, which is that I'm correct.
2749.1942756.442SPEAKER_00 and I have a child that I need to feed, I have a limited amount of time that I would rather not spend staring at the back of your fucking head while you stand around.
2756.4622757.023SPEAKER_00Those are valid reasons.
2757.2032758.464SPEAKER_00I could die here behind you.
2758.9852760.326SPEAKER_00Now, that person probably has their reasons.
2760.3662761.567SPEAKER_00Now, their reasons are probably wrong.
2761.5872764.571SPEAKER_03You're catastrophizing a little bit, I think, but go on.
2764.9112765.932SPEAKER_00 Well, I don't think in a dramatic way.
2765.9522767.073SPEAKER_03Never stopped before.
2767.1932768.514SPEAKER_03No, no, I don't think you're being dramatic.
2768.5542769.115SPEAKER_03Of course not.
2769.1752771.396SPEAKER_00I think I'm being very even keeled.
2773.2582777.822SPEAKER_00And that person, wrong as their reasons are, probably does have their reasons.
2778.0022780.524SPEAKER_00I doubt they have thought it through as thoroughly as I have.
2780.6242787.37SPEAKER_00And I doubt that they feel the certainty in their black heart that I have in my very kind of off-white one.
2793.7372799.524SPEAKER_00 Off-white as a color you should capture that that's a pretty good name for something wrong color for a heart I don't know.
2799.7442805.19SPEAKER_03I don't know I just the thing is and here's the thing I have a version of that same idea, and it's a paraphrase.
2805.232807.033SPEAKER_03I don't remember who said the original thing I
2807.4532809.658SPEAKER_03 Probably you.
2810.1182812.002SPEAKER_03Or one of the great men of history.
2812.6642814.227SPEAKER_03One of the men like me.
2815.5892817.634SPEAKER_03When I say men, I don't mean to exclude women.
2817.7542817.874SPEAKER_03No.
2818.9572820.058SPEAKER_00 But it's pretty much men.
2821.3582825.42SPEAKER_03I just like to include women under the overarching category of men.
2825.82826.06SPEAKER_00Right.
2827.8412829.882SPEAKER_03Mankind, including women.
2831.2032838.086SPEAKER_00Your statements of that sort are frequently come out in the term of a dependent clause that probably could have been mostly left out.
2838.5062839.107SPEAKER_00Yeah.
2839.1472840.707SPEAKER_03Well, you're going to bleep all that anyway.
2841.0072841.208unknownYes.
2841.6082848.311SPEAKER_03But the idea that I carry around is that everybody is having a difficult day.
2849.6172861.106SPEAKER_03 Like, if you are having a difficult day, you can pretty much rest assured that everyone else is also struggling to get through today and get home and do whatever they do.
2862.2072877.36SPEAKER_03And it's a kind of shorthand that keeps me in an empathetic posture, even surrounded as I am by morons and tools.
2878.3752884.74SPEAKER_03 to know that they also are struggling and that the fact that they are a moron only makes it harder for them.
2887.1632895.55SPEAKER_03It increases my sympathetic feeling so that I don't resort to murder.
2895.912897.551SPEAKER_00Murder or justifiable homicide.
2898.2722899.833SPEAKER_03Or even just steaming.
2899.9932901.415SPEAKER_03I mean, my biggest problem
2902.5782903.94SPEAKER_03 Life is steaming.
2903.962916.611SPEAKER_03I spend so much time steaming and and I frankly my broccoli is limp from over steam dingness
2918.842920.562SPEAKER_03 But seriously, I just can't turn it off.
2921.0222923.023SPEAKER_00There's no valve.
2923.7642929.028SPEAKER_03Right now, Merlin, I swear to you, I am feuding with a half a dozen people.
2929.6682933.891SPEAKER_03And at least four of those six people don't know that we're in a feud.
2935.1722937.934SPEAKER_03I'm sitting here steaming about something, steaming.
2937.9542941.757SPEAKER_03And they're blithely going about their lives.
2943.2382946.1SPEAKER_00Not knowing that they are the constant source of steam.
2946.7562949.057SPEAKER_03 Yeah, yeah, I'm pissed at them for something.
2949.1372954.899SPEAKER_03Generally, it's that I'm pissed at them because they didn't, they owe me a phone call and now it's too late.
2955.2392960.501SPEAKER_03Now when they call, I won't accept the call because they, they screwed it up somehow.
2961.1812962.822SPEAKER_03And that steaming is no good.
2962.9622968.123SPEAKER_03You know, that's, I should go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and talk about this.
2968.1632968.704SPEAKER_00Don't do that.
2969.0842969.544SPEAKER_00Don't do that.
2972.8842973.984SPEAKER_00 I just want to point out one thing.
2975.4252980.067SPEAKER_00I'm not saying that because we are both right, everybody has to be wrong.
2980.6872981.987SPEAKER_00Because I'm not going to actually say that.
2982.2082982.728SPEAKER_00That's valid.
2982.7882985.589SPEAKER_00I think you can imply that if you have half a fucking brain.
2985.8492986.149SPEAKER_00That's smart.
2986.1692988.69SPEAKER_00I don't need to say that because that's going to make us look bad.
2988.812990.211SPEAKER_00But you should be able to pick that up.
2990.2512990.551SPEAKER_00That's A.
2991.2113003.417SPEAKER_00 Okay, but here's the thing, this is B, and this is what you and I have in common, and most people need to get in common with us, is what we're not saying that what you're doing is wrong per se, except in as much as it is wrong.
3003.8173009.841SPEAKER_00It's just more that what we're saying is that our path that we are introducing to you, keep moving and get out of the way, it helps everybody.
3010.0413018.425SPEAKER_00There's nothing about, I defy you as one of the people who needs our help to say, you show me one part of keep moving and get out of the way that harms people.
3018.7653018.985SPEAKER_03 Right.
3019.6853021.866SPEAKER_00It's hypocritical.
3022.2663022.767SPEAKER_00It does no harm.
3022.7873033.131SPEAKER_03The beauty of keep moving and get out of the way is that you can continue to do your stupid thinking within the context of either moving or getting out of the way.
3033.1913033.711SPEAKER_03Take your time.
3034.0513041.814SPEAKER_03You can be full of your own stupid thoughts and yet also be either moving or out of the way.
3042.0343042.835SPEAKER_03Yep.
3042.8553043.615SPEAKER_03That cart turns.
3044.9053052.011SPEAKER_03 Yeah, I think we've reduced it now to the colonel.
3054.8133058.956SPEAKER_03And I have to say, this is the thing about the grand unification theory.
3059.0363060.757SPEAKER_03This is the thing about Stephen Hawking.
3064.1533085.026SPEAKER_03 If his grand unification theory, or whoever comes up with that final grand unification theory that unites macro physics with microbiology, and it doesn't include keep moving or get out of the way, it cannot be exclusive of keep moving or get out of the way, right?
3085.1263087.108SPEAKER_03Because that is a core truth.
3088.0483090.53SPEAKER_03And so that truth should also be present
3091.8783096.18SPEAKER_03 In orbiting bodies, large and small.
3097.6013098.441SPEAKER_00It's absolutely true.
3098.6813099.202SPEAKER_00I can't remember.
3099.2223101.983SPEAKER_00It's a theological argument from design.
3102.2433103.204SPEAKER_00It's one of those arguments.
3103.2443110.287SPEAKER_00It's one of those arguments where, you know, God must exist because he, not the ontological, but like because God's cool.
3110.3473110.807SPEAKER_00It's one of those.
3110.8673111.988SPEAKER_00It's a Descartes thing.
3112.3083112.848SPEAKER_00I totally agree with you.
3112.8683114.209SPEAKER_03Yeah, God must exist because God's cool.
3114.3493115.67SPEAKER_03I think that is Descartes, yeah.
3116.9773118.438SPEAKER_00 I came from actually from St.
3118.4583121.86SPEAKER_00Thomas Aquinas originally, but he, I think, improved on it.
3122.1013123.041SPEAKER_00Here's the thing, though.
3123.2013124.462SPEAKER_00This is what the liberals need.
3124.5023125.303SPEAKER_00The liberals don't have this.
3125.3433128.425SPEAKER_00First of all, they lack our cocksure sense of certainty, right?
3128.6653131.167SPEAKER_00They sometimes are sure, but they very seldom put the cock in it.
3131.5273132.728SPEAKER_00And that is part of the problem.
3133.0083133.969SPEAKER_00OK, now here's the other thing.
3133.9893134.589SPEAKER_03Put the cock in it.
3134.6493136.351SPEAKER_03That's another core truth.
3136.9713137.431SPEAKER_00 That's true.
3138.0913139.052SPEAKER_00Well, I don't know.
3139.8723141.193SPEAKER_00Hawking doesn't work blue very much.
3141.4133164.922SPEAKER_00Here's the problem, and this goes straight to the Hawking, I think it's straight to the movies, and straight to the liberals, is that if you're gonna have this supernal approach to things, where you're basically walking around like hoping everything turns out okay and don't question anything, you could do a lot worse than to make your kind of BS political Weltanschauung, you could do a lot worse than making that about.
3165.8043166.745SPEAKER_00 keep moving or get out of the way.
3166.9653176.354SPEAKER_00And in fact, if I could take it and turn it briefly, I think that is the message that most of these people in Fleece need to hear, which is you, my friend, need to either keep moving or you need to get out of the way and possibly both.
3177.3353177.555SPEAKER_00Right.
3177.5753178.556SPEAKER_00That's the message.
3178.8563190.887SPEAKER_03The problem with the Fleece people is that they've taken it as their responsibility to speak on behalf of all the people who they believe
3191.9773203.161SPEAKER_03 cannot either keep moving or get out of the way because of some disadvantage that these other people have or because of the fact that they simply need an advocate.
3204.2423206.823SPEAKER_03And the fleece people are the self-appointed advocates.
3208.0643213.147SPEAKER_03 of all the great many people who either cannot keep moving or get out of the way.
3213.2273219.891SPEAKER_03And the problem is that there is no one who cannot either keep moving or get out of the way.
3219.9513221.712SPEAKER_00It's not hurting anybody except you.
3221.9123223.193SPEAKER_00Keep moving and get out of the way.
3223.2133225.815SPEAKER_03But the fleece people, as soon as they hear that,
3226.4153228.778SPEAKER_03 They think, well, what about the people who can't keep moving?
3229.0783230.199SPEAKER_00Right.
3230.2393241.291SPEAKER_00Without ever examining the fact that those people that you are supposedly quote unquote defending could actually benefit to begin with from both keeping moving and getting out of the way.
3241.3313242.232SPEAKER_00But also, you know what?
3242.5933246.517SPEAKER_00Maybe they don't need somebody who shops at Whole Foods to help explain their life to other people.
3246.7573248.998SPEAKER_03 Well, and that's the problem we get into.
3249.0783254.819SPEAKER_03So now not only there's the original person who needs to either keep moving or get out of the way.
3254.8393255.559SPEAKER_00Meaning everyone.
3256.1193266.061SPEAKER_03Now there's a fleecy beardy person and his wife with the big hoop earrings and the Guatemalan purse.
3266.2413267.022SPEAKER_00She made the earrings.
3267.0623268.462SPEAKER_00She's thinking of doing it as a business.
3268.8223290.642SPEAKER_03 And they're standing there, now they're standing there with the original person who should have kept moving or gotten out of the way, and they're trying to argue with you about how this person, you know, how they need an extra minute, or how this person shouldn't be asked to, you know, they don't understand what you mean, or... They saw something in The Nation, and with some statistics,
3291.4433293.826SPEAKER_00 about both getting out of the way and keeping moving.
3294.4463298.47SPEAKER_00There's a whole European influence from back in the, you know, 1500s here.
3298.493300.552SPEAKER_00You got a whole Cortez the Killer thing going on.
3300.8323305.857SPEAKER_03Well, the presumption is that you're getting out of the way of someone who's superior.
3305.8773309.161SPEAKER_03I mean, it instantly becomes a Marxist problem.
3310.453312.091SPEAKER_00 There's nothing to overthink here, John.
3312.2113314.373SPEAKER_00There's nothing to overthink.
3314.8133316.574SPEAKER_00This is empirical.
3317.1743317.975SPEAKER_00It's a priori.
3318.3753321.797SPEAKER_03Yeah, but you say that, but you know that the fleece people would overthink.
3321.8173321.997SPEAKER_03I'm done.
