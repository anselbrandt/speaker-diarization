      "SPEAKER_00 Is it 15% new material?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I mean, I can't tell.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 We never wrote anything down.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 John, forgive my saying.\n",

      "SPEAKER_00 Yeah, what that mean.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Thank you.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 What that mean.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 What that mean.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I met a couple of people over the last week.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  I've had a few conversations.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Well, I'll come back to being sick, though, because I think it's going to help people.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 So you're out and about is another thing.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I'm out and about, and I've had a few conversations with strangers where they were like, so what do you do?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And I'm like, well, you know, I'm a musician.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I'm in a band, rock and roll.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And they were like, wow, cool.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And I'm like, yeah.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And they're like, so that's what you do?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  Well, yeah.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I mean, I also have podcasting and they're like, podcasting?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Is that what you do?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And I was like, well, yeah.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 So anyway- I would just want to go into George Harrison mode and I would just want to be like, what will get me out of this with as little stress as possible?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 What would you like me to say that I do?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Would you like it to be even sillier?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Would you like me to say I'm an influencer?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  I've said I've had to explain or I didn't have to I could have just you know, like spilled some stuff on their tie and then run but\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  I did.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 They called the podcasters exit.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Whoops.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Let me go get a towel for you.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 He's always by the door.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 But I've had to say like, well, I've got a show where it's me and a guy and we talk and, and, uh, it's, uh, we started it back when me and a guy talking was still kind of a novel concept.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And people were like, whoa, two guys talking?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 No way.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Yeah.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  And and we've been doing it ever since so there's an unbroken, you know line of consanguinity.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Yeah And the people have gone, huh?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Okay, what's it called?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And I'm like, well, it's kind of got a funny name back when You just would name a thing And they're like and it's about and I'm like, well don't ask what it's about.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 But anyway, there's a very real possibility\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  that somebody I met over the last three days has gone home and is like, oh, I'm going to give this show a try.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And then here we are.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 They're listening right now going, what?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Am I in the show?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 But they might be pumped, because maybe they could tell something about you.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Hello, single new listener.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 And I'm sorry, we're losing you, as always.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 And when I say I'm sorry, I'm not that sorry.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 But I'm kind of expected to say that.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 No, that's in the show, too.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Sorry, not sorry.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  When was the last time that you got sick?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  Um, well, all I wanted to say about your thing, and this is the part where I think we talked about this before, is, you know, we talked, of course, we talked about one of the most important health issues facing Americans, especially in the Pacific Northwest, is stress bumps.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 And how I've stipulated that I feel like I get, like all people who get stress bumps, I get fewer of them, mostly, pound for pound, over the years.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Yep.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 You know, as the herpes virus goes back to your spine and just kind of sits there.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  Um, but like, you know when you're getting a cold sore and and the way, you know, you're getting obviously if you've got like a like you feel the thing but also I just have a sense I This is hard to control for but I feel a sense of like, oh, yeah, this is of course.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 This is a cold sore\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  You know the feeling, right?\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 And I think it's similar to me with, and as it happens for me, it's, you say scratchy throat.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 I would call it like a slightly sore, slightly dry throat is almost always my tell that I'm getting some kind of a, you know, according to Hoyle, American illness.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  Other people, you know, you get tired, you get headaches, you get the trots or something.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 In my case, it's almost always preceded by a sore throat.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Really?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 You know, I don't know.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I'm not conscious of any tells.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I feel like my first tell is a tingling on the lip.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  At which point I race to- I know, but as soon as you fear the tingle, like, isn't there, you don't get that.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 I get this thing where it's like this sense of like, oh, of course I'm about to be robbed in an alley.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 That feeling of like, oh, this thing is happening.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 No, I mean, I do connect it to feeling run down.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Oh, hell yeah.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  But but like this scratchy voice thing that I have right now.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I never have that I don't know.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 I don't know where this is coming I just saying I just had a rock show on Friday.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 I was gonna surprise you We get you know we get ke XP now, and it's what we listen to in the car.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Oh fun.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Yeah\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  Yeah, so we listened to KXP in the car, and as it happened, the other two had been driving around earlier that day, and Madeline said, it wasn't John in the morning.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Boy, I like him.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 He seems so nice.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 I think I met him once.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Isn't he nice?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 You and he would be really pretty good buds if you lived up here.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 Yeah, but you can just tell he's like a good guy.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 But anyhow, Madeline's like, well, first of all,\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  I heard that they played whoever, not John, not in the morning, played a Longwinter song, the song The Commander Thinks Aloud, and said that the Longwinters were playing a show that day is what they heard on the radio in San Francisco coming from Seattle.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01  So you did, I can, well, so now I blew my surprise.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 It's not as exciting now.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 And that's why, when you dropped your pick and you ordered somebody else to pick it up, I'm guessing Mike Squires, when you ordered someone else in the band to pick up your pick because you couldn't be fucked to do it, that was rehearsing for this show probably, right?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 For the big show, that's right.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 The big show.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And it was a show, it was an outdoor festival in the middle of West Seattle, which is one of the big neighborhoods in the city.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  And they build a big stage in the middle of the street, and there's all the stuff in a street fair.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Food booths, and soobity doobs, and finger paintings, and people on unicycles, and so forth.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And we got asked to play this show, and I did the thing where I had\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  Every piece of news about it made me have lower expectations.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Like, oh, it's at the street.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Oh no, we're playing at 10 o'clock at night?\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Like, nobody's gonna be there at 10 o'clock at night.\n",
      "SPEAKER_01 So the thing was booked, but then as evidence arose, or the time passed, there were more and more things that made you think, oh, this isn't, like it would be poorly attended, or not a big deal.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Yeah, or that people are gonna leave, you know, they're gonna stay for the first song and go, or,\n",
      "SPEAKER_00  They come for the food booths and then they stay for the lessons from John.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 Yeah, all the kids are gonna go, you know, and so as time went on I just had gotten more and more inside just like this is gonna be a humble little event and it's fine and just go with God.\n",
      "SPEAKER_00 And so when I got there and saw that it was crammed\n"
